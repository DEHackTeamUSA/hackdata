# Pocket Change

A location based augmented reality game, where the winner is society.  Players' interaction will create increased traffic for the partnering businesses, develop a revenue stream for charity, and be the source of ongoing data that can be used by the city to help its citizens.

Players will choose a team based on the social need that is most important to them.  Companies along the Elizabeth River Trail will pledge a portion of their profits to the United Way, to become a 'United WayPoint'.  Players will visit the United WayPoints and compete for control of it within the Pocket Change game.  The donations from the company that owns that WayPoint will go to the United Way cause that is associated with the controlling team.  

Players traveling along the Elizabeth River Trail will find supplies within their game, including ones sponsored by involved companies.  Players can also earn supplies by participating in community projects and events.  


The game will serve as a backdrop for data collection, and the city can use this data to meet the needs of the citizens, and modify the game.  Examples of this include
* Finding wifi and cellular deadspots
* Analyzing amenity use, such as the number of users waiting for use of amenities
* More efficient marketing of charitable and social events.
* Spending habits
* Foot Traffic and trail use mapping
* Measurement of relative importance of various social issues to the users

Many games analyze data to change their game.  This one analyzes data to change the world.
